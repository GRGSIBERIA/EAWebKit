    // To make it safe to use JavaScript on multiple threads, it is
    // important to lock before doing anything that allocates a
    // JavaScript data structure or that interacts with shared state
    // such as the protect count hash table. The simplest way to lock
    // is to create a local JSLock object in the scope where the lock 
    // must be held. The lock is recursive so nesting is ok. The JSLock 
    // object also acts as a convenience short-hand for running important
    // initialization routines.

    // To avoid deadlock, sometimes it is necessary to temporarily
    // release the lock. Since it is recursive you actually have to
    // release all locks held by your thread. This is safe to do if
    // you are executing code that doesn't require the lock, and you
    // reacquire the right number of locks at the end. You can do this
    // by constructing a locally scoped JSLock::DropAllLocks object. The 
    // DropAllLocks object takes care to release the JSLock only if your
    // thread acquired it to begin with.
