// Design Philosophy
//
// The design for this system is influenced primarily by two things:
//    1 The set of requirements that we have identified.
//        * These requirements are identified in the documentation for this system.
//    2 Existing standards and wisdom related to text processing and display.
//        a The Unicode Standard -- http://www.unicode.org
//        b HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) -- http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/
//        c CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) -- http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS
//        f OpenGL and DirectX graphics
//        d Uniscribe -- http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/uniscribe/default.htm
//        e The TrueType font standard -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truetype
