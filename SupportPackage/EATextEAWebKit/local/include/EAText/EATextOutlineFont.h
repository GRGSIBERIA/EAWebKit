        /// A font is an incarnation of a typeface. This Font class represents not just a typeface in the 
        /// conceptual sense but represents a font file itself. Thus Font is an interface to a (e.g. TrueType)
        /// font and has functionality needed to load that font and support the reading of glyphs from 
        /// that font. Given that third party libraries exist which do the work of navigating TrueType font
        /// file records and do the work of converting outlines to bitmaps, a TrueType implementation of the
        /// Font class is relatively simple and small. 
        ///
        /// It is intended that a user of this class would implement glyph bitmap caching. This class doesn't 
        /// implement such caching itself, as that is outside the scope of responsibility for this class. 
        /// The format of a bitmap cache is likely to be specific to the texture formats in use with the 
        /// rasterizing software and hardware. Also, caching algorithms may be specific to the given application
        /// at hand. Note also that what is said here about bitmap caching applies equally to outline caching.
        ///
        /// You will note that there is a distinction between characters and glyph ids that is made in the API.
        /// This is both proper and important. Fonts don't have characters, they have glyphs. In most cases, 
        /// there is a 1:1 mapping of characters to glyphs, but this is not always so. A font has one or more
        /// mappings from characters to glyphs, though some glyphs (e.g. ligatures) are not mapped from any
        /// character. It is also more efficient to work in terms of glyphs instead of characters, as any API
        /// call that works with a character would have to convert it to a glyph in order to do its task.
        ///
        /// The only supported character mapping is UCS Unicode. Thus all Chars must be UCS Unicode encoded and 
        /// multibyte encodings such as Chinese Big5, Windows MBCS, and UTF8 Unicode are not recognized. You can
        /// convert multibyte encodings to UCS Unicode with utility functions if needed.
