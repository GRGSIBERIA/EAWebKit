    /// AutoRefCount
    /// 
    /// This is a class that acts like the C++ auto_ptr class except that instead
    /// of deleting its member data when it goes out of scope, it Releases its
    /// member data when it goes out of scope. This class thus requires that the 
    /// templated data type have an AddRef and Release function. Normally this 
    /// means the templated type is an IUnknown32 or IRefCount.
    /// This class is useful for automatically releasing an object when this 
    /// class goes out of scope. See below for some usage.
    /// You should be careful about putting instances of this class as members of 
    /// another class. If you do so, then the AutoRefCount destructor will only
    /// be called if the object that owns it is destructed. This creates a potential
    /// chicken-and-egg situation. What if the AutoRefCount member contains a 
    /// pointer to an object that has a reference on the object that owns the 
    /// AutoRefCount member? The answer is that the neither object can ever be
    /// destructed. The solution is to:
    ///    1) Be very careful about what objects you put into member AutoRefCount objects.
    ///    2) Clear out your AutoRefCount members in your shutdown function.
    ///    3) Simply don't use AutoRefCount objects as class members.

    ///    AutoRefCount<IWidget> pWidget = new Widget;
