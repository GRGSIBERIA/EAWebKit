// This file provides the following macros:

//     EATEXT_SA_NEW_ARRAY(Class, pAllocator, pName, nCount)
//     EATEXT_SA_DELETE(pObject, pAllocator)
//     EATEXT_SA_DELETE_ARRAY(pArray, pAllocator)
//
// These are useful for creating and destroying arbitrary C++ class instances 
// via ICoreAllocator-derived memory. 
//
// Note that you don't need to use these macros nor the create_object 
// functions if you can instead overload operator new for a given class. 
// This is often the case when you are defining the class yourself as opposed 
// to working with some arbitrary class that somebody else created and you 
// are merely working with.

///
/// Macro to use operator new via PPMalloc/Stack interface. This macro is not 
/// required, as you can directly use Allocator::create_object / delete_object.
/// This is the single object version of new, to create an array of objects,
/// use EATEXT_SA_NEW_ARRAY instead.
///
/// See Allocator::create_object for details regarding behaviour of this 
/// system of object allocation. 
///
/// Note that you don't need to use these macros nor the create_object functions
/// if you can instead overload operator new for a given class. This is often
/// the case when you are defining the class yourself as opposed to working with
/// some arbitrary class that somebody else created and you are merely working with.
///
/// To do: Find a way to implement file/line recording functionality.
///
/// Example usage:
///     Widget* pWidget = EATEXT_SA_NEW(Widget, pAllocator);
///     EATEXT_SA_DELETE(pWidget, pAllocator);

///     Widget* pWidget = EATEXT_SA_NEW_ARRAY(Widget, pAllocator, 10);
