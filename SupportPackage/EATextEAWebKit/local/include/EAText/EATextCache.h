// GlyphCache Texture Mechanism
//
// A cache texture is divided into a number of predefined vertical bins (columns).
// Also, there is an open area on the right side of the texture which handles
// overflow from the columns on the left side. The left-most columns are 
// narrow and handle thin glyphs such as the ones shown below. As we move
// rightward, successive columns are wider. Glyphs are added to each column
// until the column runs out of space, at which point the glyph is tried in 
// the next column, and so on.
//
// Each column is on a four pixel x boundary. And each character vertically
// within a column begins on a four pixel y boundary. There is at least one
// blank pixel between each glyph. This is done because some texture sampling
// will read outside of the glyph, and we don't want to read pixels from 
// other glyphs.
//
